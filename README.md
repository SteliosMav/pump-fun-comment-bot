## 🧠 How It Avoids Detection

To stay one step ahead of anti-spam systems, the bot uses:

- ✅ Randomized human-like comment patterns.
- ✅ A growing dataset of phrases, emojis, and slang for natural variation.
- ✅ Rate limiting and delays to mimic human activity.
- ✅ Rotating residential & datacenter proxies via a **proxy rotator** service.
- ✅ Account freshness rotation: new accounts are recycled and renamed to avoid fingerprinting.
